# FizzBuzz in Go

Write a method which takes a positive integer and returns:
* "Fizz" if the number is a multiple of 3;
* "Buzz" if the number is a multiple of 5;
* "FizzBuzz" if the number is a multiple of 3 and 5;
* The original number if none of the above apply.

## Approach

Since you need to declare return types in Go, and both values must be returned by the function, each case returns a string and the original integer.
